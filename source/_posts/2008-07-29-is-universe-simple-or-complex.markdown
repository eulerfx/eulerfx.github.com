The [Law of Large Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) and the [Central Limit Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) imply that the world is in a state that has the highest probability in relation other conceivable states. The previous statement refers to the world as a whole and thus minor variations in the probabilities of proximal states are expected. The fundamental technique in the mentioned mathematical theories is that of measuring the likelihood of an outcome based on a determined function. In particular cases, such as the familiar deck of cards, this function is derived from ratios of expected cards versus the entire sample space - the deck. It is reasonable to believe that the things that happen, in a large environment and over a sufficient period of time, are the things that have the highest probability. In fact this empirical data is where the probability functions derive from. The question here is whether these things that do happen are simple or complex. And surely the next question asks for the definition of simplicity and complexity.
