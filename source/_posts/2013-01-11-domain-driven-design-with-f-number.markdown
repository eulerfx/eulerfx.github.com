__In this post I will explore F# and the functional paradigm as applied to Domain-Driven Design. Initially, I will explain my motivation for abandoning my dear C#. Next, I cover some F# basics that make it a lucrative alternative to C# and similar languages even without the use of more advanced functional techniques. Subsequent posts will dig deeper.__

To paraphrase [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/258316233068396544), first one learns the power of abstraction, then one learns the cost of abstraction. The cost is governed by various factors including inadequacy of programming languages, leaky abstractions and limitations of the mind. Abstraction is an tantalizing muse indeed and boasts countless war stories all bearing a striking resemblance to the [myth of Icarus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus#The_myth). I have such stories and over time they have chiseled away at my dream of abstractional nirvana. I've learned to accept inadequacy and resort to brute force in the name of utilitarianism.
