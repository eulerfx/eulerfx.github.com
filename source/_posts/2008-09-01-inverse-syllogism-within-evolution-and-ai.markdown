A.I. purports to understand thought and create systems that are able to perform thought, or think. In this endeavor we attempt to observe, study and analyze our own thinking, and make conclusions about thinking in general. These conclusions become the axioms in the syllogisms of Aristotle. Subsequently, traditional intelligence models follow this paradigm. An important observation is that these models are not only designed to follow syllogisms, but are also arrived at in the same fashion. This however is in great contrast to how our own intelligence evolved. Our own intelligence evolved through millions of years of random trial and error, extinction and survival. The logical backbone behind the rationality humans posses is the confluence of our environment and the challenges it entails for survival, which of course is a requisite for any sort of intelligence to exist.
