In problem solving, I noticed that using paper to write notes on, or to track my thought process would ultimatly obstruct the generation of a novel solution. Most notably, this pattern emerges in difficult problems, requiring extensive imagination, observation and aspect recognition. I think the reason is quite straightforward. Intricate concepts cannot be represented on paper. Viewing paper as a storage medium, it is evident that it can be used to record statements or symbolic expressions. This is usefull because the reserve of information that can be immediatly memorized and quickly recalled is relatively small and is fast exhausted. The central observation here is once again an instance of my foundational conjecture upon the kernel of intelligence - forward-backward interaction and emergent properties.

A particular habit emerges, when using paper to register the thought process. Thinking is discretely partitioned to generate expressions that can be recorded on paper. This not only bounds imagination, but focuses thinking on irrelevant, or obvious information; it focuses thinking on static data, rather than the creation of new information. For the sake of this discussion, information is a static representation of some process. Information does not create new information. Instead, some sort of process must occur. I believe this process is the cradle of intelligence and by its nature of being a process it cannot be represented through a timeless medium. Its very essence is held in its existence in time and vice-versa.

The practical observation is that I can better work with concepts purely in my mind, without paper. I notice this time and time again.
