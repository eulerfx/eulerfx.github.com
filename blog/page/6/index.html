		<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">Central Limit Theorem</a> imply that the world is in a state that has the highest probability in relation other conceivable states. The previous statement refers to the world as a whole and thus minor variations in the probabilities of proximal states are expected. The fundamental technique in the mentioned mathematical theories is that of measuring the likelihood of an outcome based on a determined function. In particular cases, such as the familiar deck of cards, this function is derived from ratios of expected cards versus the entire sample space - the deck. It is reasonable to believe that the things that happen, in a large environment and over a sufficient period of time, are the things that have the highest probability. In fact this empirical data is where the probability functions derive from. The question here is whether these things that do happen are simple or complex. And surely the next question asks for the definition of simplicity and complexity.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A.I. purports to understand thought and create systems that are able to perform thought, or think. In this endeavor we attempt to observe, study and analyze our own thinking, and make conclusions about thinking in general. These conclusions become the axioms in the syllogisms of Aristotle. Subsequently, traditional intelligence models follow this paradigm. An important observation is that these models are not only designed to follow syllogisms, but are also arrived at in the same fashion. This however is in great contrast to how our own intelligence evolved. Our own intelligence evolved through millions of years of random trial and error, extinction and survival. The logical backbone behind the rationality humans posses is the confluence of our environment and the challenges it entails for survival, which of course is a requisite for any sort of intelligence to exist.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There seems to exist natural beginnings of thought in approaching problems to be solved. As an example take the problem of finding the volume of a solid. It is natural and certainly reasonable to think that the volume is related to the shape and size, therefore it is possible to measure. This vague notion of relationship eventually develops into a more formal notion of function and thus a strict formula. At this point a natural inclination, and a general pattern of human thought is abstraction. We now seek similarities between measuring the volume of different solids. Skipping ahead to the mathematics of real analysis we have measure theory, integration theory, etc. These theories we developed from this cycle of making particular observations and then creating generalizations. Thus after the efforts of hundreds of years of mathematical research we have the ability to measure the volume of a solid, and therefore a mathematical theory of measuring - measure theory. When a new generation of mathematicians is learning the work of the past they approach solved problems from the perspective of these theories. The important thing to note is that this is the reverse of the approach that resulted in the theories. A student&#8217;s effort is then directed towards understanding the theory, or in essence an encoded thought of another mathematician, instead of understanding the problem the theory addresses in the first place. Not to say it is a wasted effort it is an interesting pattern in learning.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>With the premise that people eventually develop an idea of what a pattern is, we can sidestep the potentially lengthy and possibly inconclusive discussion of the complete definition of a pattern. Now, we can view a pattern as a structure, perhaps with the additional property of repetition in some dimension. A further interpretation is that a pattern is a set of statements, whose vocabulary may range an entire language. Most dictionary definitions of a pattern will inherit this general form. A different perspective on a pattern lies within the process of its recognition. In a sense, a pattern begins to exist, or have any tangible interface at the moment it is recognized. Thus the recognizer of a pattern contains knowledge of what a pattern is, and what it is not, and also a certain will and ability to recognize it. Then offcourse that which is recognized to have a pattern, or be a pattern does not on its own contain this knowledge, will and ability. It does not contain the concept of a pattern, but is instead is an instance of one, an instance of a concept which is defined strictly in the recognizer. The previous sentences cultivated certain linguistic ambiguities - is a pattern something can be, or that something can have, or both? This ambiguity proves difficult to resolve, due to the inherent ambiguity in the qualifiers is and has. Certainly if we suppose that anything begins to have any definition, or a meaning only when it is perceived, or conceived, then the is qualifier really denotes what something is perceived, or conceived to be. Any questions of the validity of these perceptions and conceptions, are litterally out of scope here, since we do not yet have a clear definition of the idea of validity itself. Notwithstanding the resultant incompleteness of the definition of the is qualifier, it seems possible to further consider the former notions. Overall, the use, or execution of the is qualifier then implies this perceptual/conceptual interaction between an object and the observer. Returning to patterns, the question of whether something can have a pattern, or be a pattern, becomes merely a matter of perceptual, or conceptual interest and focus, which again surfaces the notion of a will - defined in any of the usual ways. In this way, the recognition of a mattern is a sort of match between the recognizers notion of a pattern, and what the recognizer perceives of conceives. The word match, more specifically denotes the existence of some sort of similarity or equivelence class. The case that two objects belong to the same similarity class is thus denoted by the symbol &#8216;match&#8217;. The properties and behaviors of this similarity class are essentially isomorphic to those of the notion of being similar. The recognizer then contains the implications of this similarity - more specifically, the similarity between some perceptual information and the concept of a pattern, results in the perceptual information being recognized as a pattern. And thus we behold a pattern. Surely a pattern is more than just an instance of this rather general notion of a similarity class, perception, etc. A pattern exhibits additional definable properties and behaviors, after all, without which this discussion is misnamed. The attempt to discover exactly what these properties are, results in a strange loop. As stated previously, a pattern is a structure and a recognition of a structure is really the process by which the appropriate similarity class is instantiated, percisely in the manner that perception of conception itself occurs. Layering recognition iteself onto a spectrum, one can judge the extent to which a structure may be a recognized as pattern, simultanuously creating another dimension with which to understand a pattern.</p>
